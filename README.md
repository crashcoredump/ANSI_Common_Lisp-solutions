ANSI_Common_Lisp-solutions
==========================

Solutions to the end-chapter exercises in Paul Graham's "ANSI Common Lisp".

Warnings and Disclaimers
------------------------

Since I'm paranoid of being accused of plagiarism, or using execerpts of
someone else's copyrighted work without permission, in any case where I've
reproduced code from the text, I've done my best to "make it my own".  So I've
adapted it to my own style and sensibility, which others may find offensive or
hard to follow (though I hope not).

One thing that I *do* know seasoned Lisp programmers will find distasteful
about my style is that, coming largely from a C and Perl background, I've
carried over their de-facto conventions for curly-braces, and applied it to the
way I use parentheses in Lisp.  I know, you're supposed to put all trailing
parens on the same line whenever possible, but I just haven't been able to
retrain myself to do that just get.

ToDo
----

I've completed the exercises for the first seven chapters, but have yet to add
anything past Chapter 3 to this repository.  I'm going through them one-by-one
to sanitize them, and make sure I'm not ripping-off Paul Graham's code
verbatim.  There were no exercises for Chapter 1, so naturally I've included no
solutions for it.  And for Chapter 2, I only have the solutions for one
exercise so far, because the rest didn't entail writing code; but I may go back
and include the answers to the rest anyway, for completeness' sake.

As part of the cleanup, I'm adding code to make the presentation a little
neater, so that someone who runs the example files doesn't get a mess of output
with no context whatsoever.  It may evolve into a unit testing framework down
the road a bit.  We'll see.
